Requires fpc and the sdl2 library to be installed.

The SDL2 files needed for FPC are from bitbucket.org/p_daniel/sdl-2-for-free-pascal-compiler.

To check out the needed files, either use checkout.sh or run the following commands:

git clone https://bitbucket.org/p_daniel/sdl-2-for-free-pascal-compiler.git temp
mv temp/SDL2 .
rm -r temp

make should produce an executable named "main".
