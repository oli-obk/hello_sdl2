Hello SDL2!
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xyproto/hello_sdl2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xyproto/hello_sdl2)

"hello world" for SDL2 for various programming languages.

Each sample creates a window, displays an image, then waits two seconds and quits.


Does not build
--------------

* GCCGo, after the sdl2 package was changed (possibly due to gccgo supporting an older version of the Go language than the Go compiler)
* Rust and Rust-Cargo (several errors that are not related to sdl2 nor the sample code)

Pull requests are welcome!
