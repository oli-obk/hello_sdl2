This sample uses MRuby.

* Install the SDL2 libraries and include files.

* Clone and build MRuby (requires bison, ruby and termcap):

  git clone https://github.com/mruby/mruby
  cd mruby
  make

* Edit build_config.rb in the mruby checkout with the SDL2 configuration from here:
  https://github.com/crimsonwoods/mruby-sdl2
  (It's the code under "How to build". It should be added in the right place in build_config.rb).

* Make sure to paste the lines within the "MRuby::Build.new do |conf|".."end" block.
  Edit the lines so that they point to the SDL2 includes and library files
  (typically /usr/include and /usr/lib).

* Optionally copy the files in the mruby/bin directory to /usr/bin and
  the files in the mruby/include directory to /usr/include.

Run the SDL2 sample with "mruby main.rb".
